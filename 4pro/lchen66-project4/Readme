How to run and some sample output:

1. start the server first using : ./test start_port_number interval_time num
2. for the server, ./server port interval_time

Possible problem:
when the nodes is large(>200), there will be too many files errors sometimes,
	 not everytime. the more nodes, the more often to happen.

I have test the project on remote.cs.binghamton machines.
