Language : c++

Main files : server.cpp, client.cpp, Makefile, sha256.h, Readme and the files generated
by thrift.


How to run and some sample output:

1. start the server first using : ./server port_number
2. I did not provide the client file since it is just for test.

I have test the project on remote.cs.binghamton machines.
